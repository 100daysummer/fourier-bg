# ES6 base
Base project for creating interactive things ES6 JavaScript. :)

## Running stuff
I typically open keep 2 terminal windows open running commands (with an additional one for git commands and such).

### Running local webserver
`npm start`
This brings up a local webserver from which you can view your changes!

### Automatically update
`npm run watch`
Whenever you save your files they'll be recompiled straight away! Cool! You typically need a hard refresh in the browser window for it to work though. Maybe I could also make the browser refresh automatically?? Maybe that's not a good idea?
